The data covers transactions that occurred between December 1, 2009 and December 9, 2011. The retailer primarily serves both individual customers and wholesalers. The products sold by the company are all-occasion gift items, including home d√©cor, kitchenware, and other unique items.\n","\n","The dataset includes detailed information on each transaction, providing valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance over time.\n","\n","\n","\n","## **What can be done with this dataset?**\n","\n","**Customer Behavior Analysis:** Explore purchasing patterns, repeat customers, and sales volume across different customer segments.\n","\n","**Sales Forecasting:** Predict future sales by analyzing past transactions, including seasonal trends and demand fluctuations.\n","\n","**Market Segmentation:** Identify customer groups based on purchase history and demographic data (e.g., by Country).\n","\n","**Product Performance:** Analyze which products are bestsellers and which have low turnover, and how prices influence sales.\n","\n","**Time Series Analysis:** Study trends over time, including hourly, daily, and monthly sales volumes, and identify peak shopping periods.\n","\n","**Anomaly Detection:** Detect potential fraudulent transactions, cancellations, or unusually high sales activity.\n","Association Rule Mining: Discover products that are often purchased together and identify cross-sell opportunities.\n","\n","\n","\n","## **Key Attributes in the Dataset:**\n","\n","**InvoiceNo:** Unique transaction identifier (with cancellations indicated by 'C' prefix).\n","\n","**StockCode:** Unique product code for each item sold.\n","\n","**Description:** Name of the product/item sold.\n","\n","**Quantity:** Quantity of each product sold in the transaction\n",".\n","**InvoiceDate:** Date and time of the transaction.\n","\n","**UnitPrice:** Price per unit of the product.\n","\n","**CustomerID:** Unique identifier for each customer.\n","\n","**Country:** The country where the customer resides.\n","\n","This dataset is a great resource for learning and practicing various data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence techniques."],"metadata":{"id":"-6dqpBX8eayc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Exercise**\n","Complete the following tasks:\n","1. Load the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/online-retail-dataset) from Kaggle.\n","2. Visualize the dataset and it's structure using appropriate libraries and plots.\n","3. Do some basic cleaning to handle missing values\n","4. Create the following features:\n","  *   Revenue\n","  *   DayOfWeek: to analyze sales trends by weekdays.\n","  *   TotalRevenue for each CustomerID\n","  *   Most popular product based on Revenue.\n","  *   Ordersize by summing Quantity for each InvoiceNo\n","5. Apply a lambda function to:\n","  * Segment customers into tiers based on TotalRevenue (e.g., \"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\").\n","  * Extract key information from Description and add them as columns (e.g., presence of specific keywords like \"Gift\" or \"Discount\"). At least one extra column should be added\n","  * Categorize transactions as \"Small\", \"Medium\", or \"Large\" based on Revenue.\n","  * **Detect Seasonal Items:** Flag items as \"Christmas\"-themed if the description contains relevant words.\n","  * Classify customers as \"Loyal\", \"Occasional\", or \"One-time\" based on the number of purchases.\n","  *  **Identify Multi-Item Invoices:** Flag invoices with multiple unique items as \"Multi-Item Order\".\n","7.
